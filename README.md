A simple C program which can run different command from a device directly on the computer using port connection.

The program detect automatically the port your device is connected and receives commands from the device.

I used an Arduino Uno board to run a command using a button. Upon the button press, a command is send to the computer and executed
by the program.
It is designed for Linux use.
